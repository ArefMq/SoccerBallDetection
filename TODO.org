1) Do something about the debugging:
The debugger should be separate from main code, however a system should be
available globally and internally for debugging. For further discussions 
talk to me directly via email: aref.moqadam@gmail.com.

2) Configuration Files:
Currently almost all of the parameters are done by c++ macros. ALL of these
should be read from a config file instead. Some sort of ini file stream should
be implemented (or some prior implementation should be used).

3) FIXME refactor:
Fix all the FIXMEs and TODOs in the code.

4) Implement a better filter for edge detection

5) Sort the detected:
Sort the detected circles in ballDetector.cpp by a factor in order to deliver
the best result (not the first one!).

6) Test the code on different platforms
Try to build the code in different platforms (different c-compilers such as
clang c++-11 c++9 c++9.8 etc. with different libc versions in different 
operating system) and fix any upcoming issues.
